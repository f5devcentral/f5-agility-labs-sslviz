SSL Orchestrator v8 - SSLO 201: Real World Use Cases (Agility 2021 | 2 hours)
================================================================================

.. note::

   **Requires UDF Blueprint: "Agility 2021 - SSL Orchestrator 201"**

   **BIG-IP 16.0 / SSL Orchestrator 8.3**

As organizational requirements change, so does the need to update security polices and apply additional features to existing F5 SSL Orchestrator deployments.  There is no need to fear required maintenance and regular upkeep of your security strategy. Maintenance can be performed within the SSLO Dashboard. It also provides enhanced statistical information which is needed to differentiate between normal and abnormal traffic.

After completing the modules in this lab, you will be familiar with:

-  Modifying existing SSL Orchestrator configurations to keep up with business and security demands

-  Integrating authentication to facilitate user-based policy enforcement and logging on an HTTP service (web proxy)

-  Implementing a layered SSL Orchestrator architecture to handle more complex logic requirements

Expected time to complete: **2 hours**
