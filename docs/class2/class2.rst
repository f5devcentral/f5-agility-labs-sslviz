================================================================================

.. note::

   **Requires UDF Blueprint: "Agility 2022 - SSL Orchestrator 201"**

   **BIG-IP 16.1 / SSL Orchestrator 9.2**

|

As organizational requirements change, so does the need to update security polices and apply additional features to existing F5 SSL Orchestrator deployments.  There is no need to fear required maintenance and regular upkeep of your security strategy. Maintenance can be performed within the SSLO Dashboard. It also provides enhanced statistical information which is needed to differentiate between normal and abnormal traffic.

After completing the modules in this lab, you will be familiar with:

-  Integrating authentication to facilitate user-based policy enforcement and logging on an HTTP service (web proxy)

-  Implementing a layered SSL Orchestrator architecture to handle more complex logic requirements

-  Deploy WAFaaS to protect an Existing Application in an inbound L3 topology

Expected time to complete: **2 hours**

Pre-requisite: Completion of the **SSL Orchestrator 101** lab is recommended prior to attending this lab.
