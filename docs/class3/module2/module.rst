Automating BIG-IP (SSL Orchestrator) Provisioning with Terraform
================================================================================

An advantage of deploying into public cloud environments is that the virtual network and VM instance provisioning can be fully automated.

In this module, you will:

-  Learn about the Terraform tool
-  Review the infrastructure needed to support SSL Orchestrator in AWS
-  Use Terraform to deploy into AWS
-  Review the configuration that is created

.. note::

   This module does not cover SSL Orchestrator Topology configuration. That will be done using a different automation tool (Ansible) in a later module.
