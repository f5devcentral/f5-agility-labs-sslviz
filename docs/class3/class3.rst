[v9] SSLO 301: Automating SSL Orchestrator Deployments in Public Cloud (Agility 2022 | 2 hours)
===============================================================================================

Deploying F5 SSL Orchestrator on public cloud infrastructure presents new challenges that are not present in traditional on-premises environments.

In this lab, you will learn about:

- Recommended practices for deploying the SSL Orchestrator solution into public cloud environments.
- How to deploy and onboard new SSL Orchestrator instances using Terraform.
- How to configure SSL Orchestrator Topologies using Ansible playbooks.

Expected time to complete: **2 hours**

Pre-requisite: Completion of the **SSL Orchestrator 101** lab is recommended prior to attending this lab session.

.. note::

   This lab relies on UDF Blueprint: **Agility 2022 - SSL Orchestrator 301**

   The code provided for this lab was tested with **BIG-IP 15.1.5.1 / SSL Orchestrator 7.5.2**. At the time of lab development, the related Ansible modules did not fully support later SSL Orchestrator versions. This lab will be modified to support newer versions of SSL Orchestrator when updated Ansible modules are released.
