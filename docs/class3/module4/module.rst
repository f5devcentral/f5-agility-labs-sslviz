Automating SSL Orchestrator Topology Configuration with Ansible
================================================================================

In the previous module, you manually created and deployed an **Inbound Layer 3 Topology** with the following:

- SSL configuration
- Inline Layer 3 Services
- Service Chains
- Security Policy
- Interception Rule
- Egress SNAT
- Log Settings
- Application Pool

In this module, you will see how easy it is to deploy the same SSL Orchestrator Topology configuration using an Ansible playbook.
