What is Ansible?
================================================================================

Ansible is an automation tool from Red Hat that is commonly used for network configuration, systems management, and code deployment.

It uses YAML syntax to define configuration **playbooks**. Playbooks contain a list of **tasks** which use Ansible **modules** to perform configuration changes on remote systems.
