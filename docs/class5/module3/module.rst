Lab 1 - BIG-IP Next Initial Setup
================================================================================

In this module, you will onboard a BIG-IP Next instance and deploy a simple HTTPS
application.

.. note::

   As there are far more comprehensive resources for describing the setup and configuration of BIG-IP Next and Central Manager, this lab guide provides only an abbreviated set of instructions for the purposes of setting up an SSL Orchestrator environment. Please refer to the official BIG-IP Next documentation for complete information on the platform:
