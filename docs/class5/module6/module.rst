Lab 4 - Automate a Deployment via API
================================================================================

In this module, you will use the BIG-IP Next API to create an SSL Orchestrator TAP inspection service, a service chain containing multiple inspection services (Inline L3, ICAP, and TAP), and a simple traffic policy. The SSL Orchestrator policy will then be applied to an inbound application.
