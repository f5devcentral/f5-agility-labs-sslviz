Module Completion
================================================================================

Congratulations! You have achieved the security objective that your manager has challenged you with. Your users are now made aware of risky sites that may compromise your organization's confidential and proprietary data. Plus, you have the ability to track usage of these web sites for future allow/deny-listing. As a result, your manager has rewarded you with an all-expenses paid vacation to the destination of your choice.

In this lab module, you completed the following tasks:

- Created an **L3 Outbound** (transparent forward proxy) topology deployment with **user coaching** functionality to inform users when they are attempting to connect to a risky web site.
- Customized the deployment to require user justification before permitting access to risky sites.
