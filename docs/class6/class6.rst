SSLO 202: More Use Cases with F5 BIG-IP SSL Orchestrator (AppWorld 2025 | 2 hours)
===============================================================================================

|

.. note::

   This lab relies on UDF Blueprint: **AppWorld 2025 - SSL Orchestrator 202**

   Developed and tested with **BIG-IP 17.1.2 / SSL Orchestrator 11.1.8**.

|

SSL Orchestrator was built to protect your organization from encrypted threats. In previous labs, you learned how to deploy **inbound application mode** (reverse-proxy) and **outbound explicit** (forward proxy) Topologies with security Inspection Services based on simple policies. Now, let's dive into some additional use-cases.

|

In this lab, you will learn how to:

- Deploy an **inbound gateway mode** (reverse-proxy) Topology to perform TLS inspection for multiple backend applications
- Implement an **L3 outbound** (transparent forward proxy) Topology with user confirmation for suspicious destinations


Expected time to complete: **90 minutes** (excluding lab instructor presentations)

Pre-requisite: Basic familiarity with SSL Orchestrator is recommended, but not required.
