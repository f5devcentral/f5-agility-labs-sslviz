      TLS SNI, HTTP Connect and HTTP Host information.

-  **Action** - select :red:`Allow`.

-  **SSL Forward Proxy Action** - select :red:`Bypass`.

-  **Service Chain** - select the :red:`ssloSC_all_services` service chain.

Financial and medical site test
---------------------------------

- Return to your Ubuntu client RDP session.

- Open Chromium web browser on the outbound client system and navigate to https://bcbs.com. 

- Once the site opens in the browser, check the server certificate of the site.

**Notice that it now shows it is issued by a public CA (not SSL Orchestrator).  This means that this traffic is not decrypted because it belongs to the Health and Medicine URL category.**

- Try the same test for https://wellsfargo.com.  This certificate should also be signed by a public CA, and therefore not decrypted, as it belongs to the Financial Data and Services URL category.
