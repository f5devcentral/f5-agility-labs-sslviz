SSL Orchestrator Lab Environment
================================================================================

Accessing the Virtual Lab
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are not familiar with the process for joining a training course, refer to:

- |join_link|
- |interface_link|

You should have received a course registration email that contains the UDF course link. Click on the link and log into the UDF student portal. 

After joining the course, you will see the **DOCUMENTATION** tab with some information about the lab resources and a link to the Lab Guide (this document).

.. note::

   You will use your local web browser and Remove Desktop Protocol (RDP) client to perform the lab exercises.
   
   You will not need to use SSH to access the UDF lab environment, so no SSH Key needs to be configured.

Click on the **DEPLOYMENT** tab to see all of your lab resources. You will access the **Ubuntu18.04 Client** and **Windows Client** machines using **RDP**. You will also access the **Web Shell** for various systems as directed in the lab exercises.

Network Diagram
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a visual representation of the Agility virtual lab environment. The numbers inside the right edge of the SSL Orchestrator box indicate the port numbers and VLAN tags (if applicable). The colored boxes to the right of the services respresent some product examples for each respective service type.

The first interface is connected to the client-facing VLAN. The second interface is connected to the Internet-facing VLAN. The remaining interfaces are connected to various types of security services: L2, L3, HTTP, ICAP, and passive Tap. The SSL Orchestrator management interface is not shown.
