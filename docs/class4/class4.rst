SSL Orchestrator with Secure Web Gateway (SWG) as a Service 
==================================================================================================


.. note::

   **Requires UDF Blueprint: "SSLO: Essential SSL Visibility and SWG as a Service"**

   **BIG-IP 16.1 / SSL Orchestrator 9.2**

The F5 SSL Orchestrator solution maximizes network traffic visibility,
security, and reduces infrastructure efficiencies by:

- Effectively decrypting and inspecting SSL/TLS traffic

- Applying a policy-driven approach to intelligently steer traffic flows through security service chains

- Supporting multiple deployment modes for flexibility in integrating with complex architectures

SSL Orchestrator 9.2 supports the ability to insert F5's Secure Web Gateway (SWG) service into service chains
 

Attend this lab to get a hands-on introduction to the F5 SSL Orchestrator solution as well as gain hands-on experience
configuring the Secure Web Gateway as an SSL Orchestrator Service. 

Expected time to complete: **2 hours**
