Configuring custom SWG Per-Request Policies and URL Category Filters
===========================================================================

**Important Points**

-  SWG must be licensed and provisioned
-  To get SWG reporting, URL Request logging must be configured
-  Per-Session Access Profiles with a simple **start - allow** are sufficient
   since the Per-Request policy handles the bulk of SWG processing
-  **Access Profile Scope** - For this lab we will simply be using **Named** scopes

-  The first task will be to create a custom URL category filter

  You configure a URL filter to specify whether to allow, block, or confirm requests
  for URLs in URL categories. You can also configure multiple URL filters.  Default URL filters,
  such as block-all and basic-security, are available.

- On the Main tab, click **Access, Policy, Secure Web Gateway, URL Filters.**
- You can click the name of any filter to view its settings.

  The URL Filters screen displays.

  To configure a new URL filter, click one of these options.

- **Create button** Click to start with a URL filter that allows all categories.

- In the **Name** field, type a unique name for the URL filter.

- Click **Finished.**

  The screen redisplays. An Associated Categories table displays.
  It includes each URL category and the filtering action that is
  currently assigned to it. The table includes a Sub-Category column.
  Any URL categories that were added by administrators are subcategories
  within Custom Categories. To block access to particular categories
  or subcategories, select them and click Block.  When you select a category,
  you also select the related subcategories. You can expand the category
  and clear any subcategory selections.  Expand the category Miscellaneous,
  select Uncategorized, and then click **Block.**  To allow access to particular
  categories or subcategories, select them and click **Allow.**  To indicate that
  you want a user to confirm that access is work-related or otherwise justified
  before obtaining access to the URLs in a category, select the categories or
  subcategories and click **Confirm.**

- To put a URL filter into effect, you must assign it in a per-request policy which
  runs each time a user makes a URL request.

Creating an SWG per-request policy
===========================================================================

   From the left-hand menu, navigate to
   **Access, Profiles/Policies, Per-Request Policies**. Click
   the **Create** button.

-  **Name** enter a unique name
-  **Policy Type** select **SSL Orchestrator**
-  **Incomplete Action** select **All**
-  **Customization Type** select the appropriate language(s)

   Once complete, edit the new SWG per-request policy VPE.  You can begin
   adding functionality directly, or you can start with one of the pre-built macro templates.
   Click the **Add New Macro** button and select from one of the three templates and click
   **save**.  Now add that macro to the primary policy flow to enable it.  Make any additional
   modifications as requred.

-  While most options are possible within the SWG per-request policy
   several are not appropriate for an inline SWG service including the list
   below.

-  Assignment
      **Pool Assignment**
-  General
      **IP Based SSL Bypass Set, Server Cert Response Control, Server Cert Status, SSL Check, SSL Intercept Set, SSL Configuration Select**
-  Traffic Management
      **Proxy Select, Service Connect, Session Check**


Applying the new Per-Request policy to SSL Orchestrator
===========================================================================

-  Once the new Per-Request policy has been configured it can then be applied
   to the SSL Orchestrator Topology.

Testing URL filtering
===========================================================================

- establish an **XRDP** session to the **Ubuntu14.04 Desktop Outbound**
  client

- Launch either a web browser of your choice (Firefox, Chrome) and
  test various URL's to ensure the URL Filters are being applied correctly

This concludes the SSL Orchestrator lab
