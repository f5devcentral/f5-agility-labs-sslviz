SSL Orchestrator v9 - SSL Orchestrator Consolidated Services Architecture 
==================================================================================================


As the volume of data continues to grow at a rapid pace, more organizations are
deploying Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) solutions
to encrypt data in transit. This is a great win for security overall to help
protect privacy and prevent data breaches. However, cyber criminals are also
using SSL/TLS channels to propagate malware and exfiltrate data.
They know that they can bypass traditional security inspection solutions,
which may not have the ability to inspect encrypted traffic.

The F5 SSL Orchestrator solution maximizes network traffic visibility,
security, and reduces infrastructure efficiencies by:

- Effectively decrypting and inspecting SSL/TLS traffic

- Applying a policy-driven approach to intelligently steer traffic flows through security service chains

- Supporting multiple deployment modes for flexibility in integrating with complex architectures

- As of SSL Orchestrator 9.2 you are now able to insert F5’s Secure Web Gateway (SWG) service
 

Attend this lab to get a hands-on introduction to the F5 SSL Orchestrator solution as well as gain hands-on experience
configuring the Secure Web Gateway as an SSL Orchestrator Service.
