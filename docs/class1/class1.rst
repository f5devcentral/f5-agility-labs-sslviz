Class 1: SSL Orchestration
==========================

F5 SSL Orchestrator provides high-performance decryption of inbound and
outbound SSL/TLS traffic, enabling security inspection to expose threats
and stop attacks. Dynamic service chaining and policy-based traffic
steering allow organizations to intelligently manage encrypted traffic
flows across the entire security chain with optimal availability.

SSL Orchestrator ensures encrypted traffic can be decrypted, inspected
by security controls, then re-encrypted, delivering enhanced visibility
to mitigate threats traversing the network. As a result, organizations
maximize their security services investment for malware, data loss
prevention (DLP), ransomware, and next-generation firewalls (NGFW),
thereby preventing inbound and outbound threats, including exploitation,
callback, and data exfiltration.

This class covers the following topics:

-  SSLO Deployment Settings
-  Security Services Creation
-  Classification and Interception Rules
-  Outbound and Inbound Use cases

Expected time to complete: **4 hours**
